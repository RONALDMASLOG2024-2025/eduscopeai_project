# EduScopeAI 🧫🔍  
An Image-Based AI System for Educational Microorganism Detection

EduScopeAI is a web-based platform that utilizes YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) object detection along with OpenAI’s language model (GPT-4) to detect and identify common microorganisms from microscope images. Designed for students, teachers, and life science educators, the system not only identifies organisms but also provides educational descriptions to promote deeper understanding.

---

## 📦 Features

- 🔬 Detects 8 types of microorganisms:
  - Amoeba
  - Euglena
  - Hydra
  - Paramecium
  - Rod Bacteria
  - Spherical Bacteria
  - Spiral Bacteria
  - Yeast
- 🤖 Built with YOLOv8 object detection model (Ultralytics)
- 🧠 Integrated with OpenAI GPT-4 for dynamic explanations
- 🖼 Upload an image → Get annotated results + AI-generated description
- 📊 Includes model performance metrics: Precision, Recall, mAP, Confusion Matrix

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/eduscopeai.git
cd eduscopeai
````

### 2. Set up your environment

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and pip installed.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Place the trained model

Place your best.pt (YOLOv8 trained weights) file inside a folder named model/:

```
model/best.pt
```

Or update the path in app.py to match where your model is stored.

### 4. Configure OpenAI API Key

Create a .env file in the project root:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

This enables educational explanations powered by GPT.

### 5. Run the Flask app

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

## 🖼 Sample Use

1. Upload a microscope image containing visible organisms.
2. Click the "Identify" button.
3. The system will:

   * Detect microorganisms using YOLOv8
   * Display labeled bounding boxes on the image
   * Show count of each organism
   * Generate educational explanations using OpenAI

## 📊 Model Performance (YOLOv8)

| Metric        | Value (Approximate) |
| ------------- | ------------------- |
| Precision     | 87.3%               |
| Recall        | 85.1%               |
| mAP\@0.5      | 89.6%               |
| mAP\@0.5:0.95 | 64.2%               |

These values were achieved during training on a synthetic microorganism dataset sourced from Kaggle.
